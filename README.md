Bash function for sourcing custom modules to dynamically modify user's enviornment

(Hello Marcos, I could not find an alternative way to contact you so I am using this weird approach, i hope you do not mind).

By way of introduction my name is Pavlos Christoforou and I run technology at PointNine (www.p9ft.com) a London/Cyprus based company focusing on post trade processing (DTCC/OTC/settlements/reporting etc). We are a python house and our strength is technology. By coincidence I also live in Rome and work from here. I also noted the PyRome google + which I would like to follow and perhaps attend some of the meetups but I have not figured out google+ yet. In any case if you are still involved in operations technology perhaps we should get in touch should you wish so there could be interesting opportunities to collaborate. My email is pavlos  and the stuff after the at symbol is p9ft.com. Cheers
